        <h2>The Magnificent Meyersons</h2>
        <p> The story of one extraordinary New York family, on a day that starts out like any other, full of small hostilities, self-doubt, moments of tenderness, and the other quotidian battles and joys that comprise a normal day in the big city. But on this day, something unique will happen -- a scientific revelation, perhaps the most significant one in the history of humanity. This discovery, while more theoretical than actual, will affect each member of the family in a different way -- and, when, at this very moment of flux, a specter from the past comes back into their lives, they are forced to reevaluate their past decisions and their future choices.</p>
